 # DEEPFAKE-IMAGE-DETECTION
 ðŸ§  Deepfake Image Detection 

A lightweight and automated deepfake image detection pipeline built for ease of use and reproducibility. This project leverages Python and batch scripting to streamline environment setup, dependency installation, and detection execution in a Windows environment.

 

 ðŸš€ Project Description 

Deepfakes pose serious threats to digital trust. This project provides a minimal yet functional starter kit for detecting deepfake images using Python-based detection logic. The pipeline is encapsulated within a batch script to simplify the user experience, making it ideal for rapid prototyping, academic research, or proof-of-concept demonstrations.
